# DOFTool Brand Strategy

## Brand name

DOFTool

## Long name

Decentralized Organization Family Tool

## Positioning

A sophisticated yet approachable family collaboration tool that helps households coordinate calendars, tasks, and communication through decentralized, shared ownership and offline-first technology.

## Core brand ideas

- Decentralization as empowerment
- Family unity through shared responsibility
- Calm, reliable organization
- Transparent collaboration and decision-making

## Brand attributes

- Trustworthy
- Connected
- Modern
- Warm
- Clear

## Tone of voice

- Short, clear sentences
- Friendly and supportive
- Avoid jargon in UI labels
- Use “family” and “shared” language (e.g., “Shared calendar”, “Family tasks”)

## Visual identity principles

- Use a warm, paper-like background to keep the UI approachable
- Use a cool primary (teal) to signal technology + trust
- Use a warm accent (orange) for highlights and calls-to-action
- Use subtle network/connection motifs (nodes + links) to suggest distributed collaboration

## Logo concept

A simplified house shape (family/home) combined with three connected nodes (distributed authority / network). The mark should remain readable at small sizes, work in monochrome, and feel friendly rather than corporate.

## Color palette

- Primary (Teal): trust, connectivity, modern technology
- Accent (Warm Orange): warmth, action, optimism
- Background (Warm Paper): comfort, readability
- Foreground (Deep Slate): clarity, professionalism

## Typography

- UI font: Inter (already in the project)
- Use clear hierarchy: strong headings, readable body, restrained use of bold

## UI patterns

- Prefer high-contrast text for accessibility
- Use rounded corners and soft surfaces to avoid harsh “enterprise” feel
- Keep navigation and “status” indicators compact and scannable
